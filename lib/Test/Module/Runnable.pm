=head1 NAME

Test::Module::Runnable - A runnable framework on Moose for running tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   package YourTestSuite;
   use Moose;
   use Test::More 0.96;

   extends 'Test::Module::Runnable';

   sub helper { } # Not called

   sub testExample { } # Automagically called due to 'test' prefix.

   package main;

   my $tester = new YourTestSuite;
   plan tests => $tester->testCount;
   foreach my $name ($tester->testMethods) {
     subtest $name => $tester->$name;
   }

alternatively...

   my $tester = new YourTestSuite;
   return $tester->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A test framework based on Moose introspection to automagically
call all methods matching a user-defined pattern.  Supports per-test
setup and tear-down routines and easy early L<Test::Builder/BAIL_OUT> using
L<Test::More>.

=head1 USER DEFINED METHODS

=over

=item C<setUpBeforeClass>

If you need to initialize your test suite before any tests run,
this hook is your opportunity.  If the setup fails, you should
return C<EXIT_FAILURE>.  you must return C<EXIT_SUCCESS> in order
for tests to proceed.

Don't write code here!  Override the method in your test class.

The default action is to do nothing.

=cut

sub setUpBeforeClass {
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

=item C<tearDownAfterClass>

If you need to finalize any cleanup for your test suite, after all
tests have completed running, this hook is your opportunity.  If the
cleanup fails, you should return C<EXIT_FAILURE>.  If cleanup succeeds,
you should return C<EXIT_SUCCESS>.  You can also perform final sanity checking
here, because retuning C<EXIT_FAILURE> causes the suite to call
L<Test::Builder/BAIL_OUT>.

Don't write code here!  Override the method in your test class.

The default action is to do nothing.

=cut

sub tearDownAfterClass {
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

=item C<setUp>

If you need to perform per-test setup, ie. before individual test methods
run, you should override this hook.  You must return C<EXIT_SUCCESS> from
the hook, otherwise the entire test suite will be aborted via L<Test::Builder/BAIL_OUT>.

Don't write code here!  Override the method in your test class.

The default action is to do nothing.

=cut

sub setUp {
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

=item C<tearDown>

If you need to perform per-test cleanup, ie. after individual test methods
run, you should override this hook.  You must return C<EXIT_SUCCESS> from
the hook, otherwise the entire test suite will be aborted via L<Test::Builder/BAIL_OUT>.
